									<h1>Hello! I'm Imran</h1>
									<p>I'm passionate about everything tech.</p>
								</header>
								<p>Hi, I'm Imran a tech enthusiast from Hertfordshire. First & foremost, I'm a student, I love to learn! In my spare time I work on improving my IT Skills, my main method of study is utilising online resources but my favorite way to learn is by practicing! My goal is to become a skilled software developer.  Currently I work at Hertfordshire Independent Living Service a local nonprofit as a team we provide support to our clients who are elderly or vulnerable.  </p>
								<hr />
								<p>I like to understand the fundamentals of how things work. I have grown with the rapid barrages of ever-changing technology and I never fail to keep up with current innovation. As a person, I am reliable and self-motivated to complete tasks that I come across. I am passionate about learning new skills. I always question what I do not understand and make it a goal to seek advice so I can improve on anything until I am fully confident and sure in my abilities. I am able to use my initiative to ensure that all work is done efficiently and to the correct standard. I am determined in achieving goals and have ambitions that I am working towards achieving. Iâ€™m looking for a role where I can develop my professional skills in a supportive and engaging environment. </p>

								<p>I enjoy reading, using most technology and being challenged. Learning new languages is a valued quality that I am passionate about it enables me to interact with people and develop my skills. As of late, I've been an active member of an investing group, in which we have constantly been overcoming many difficult challenges. This has enabled me to interact with a large amount of people to focus on completing goals as a team. I've been given many roles in my work and in my education, representing these groups and showing my ability to adapt quickly to different types of people. I've been assigned as a leader for different tasks, providing me with many opportunities to prove my leadership skills.</p>
